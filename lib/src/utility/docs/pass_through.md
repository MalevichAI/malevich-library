# Pass Through Component

## General Purpose

The Pass Through component is designed to serve as a straightforward conduit within a product pipeline. Its primary function is to receive tabular data and pass it through without making any modifications. This component can be particularly useful for preserving the data flow structure in a pipeline or for testing purposes where the unaltered data needs to be examined downstream.

## Input and Output Format

**Input Format:** The component accepts tabular data in a standardized format that is compatible with the platform's data handling conventions.

**Output Format:** The output of this component is identical to the input - tabular data in the same format as it was received.

## Configuration Parameters

The Pass Through component does not require any configuration parameters, as it is designed to simply pass the data through without any changes.

## Detailed Parameter Descriptions

Since the Pass Through component does not alter the data, there are no configuration parameters to describe. It is a plug-and-play component that requires no additional setup or customization.
